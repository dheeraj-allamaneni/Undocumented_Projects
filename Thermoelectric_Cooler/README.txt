Designed and Developed a intelligent Thermoelectric cooler which works on the principle of  Peltier effect.

 A Peltier cooler, heater, or thermoelectric heat pump is a solid-state active heat pump which transfers heat
 from one side of the device to the other, with consumption of electrical energy, depending on the direction 
 of the current. Such an instrument is also called a Peltier device, Peltier heat pump, solid state 
 refrigerator, or thermoelectric cooler (TEC). It can be used either for heating or for cooling, although
 in our project the main application is cooling.
 
      Operating principle:Thermoelectric coolers operate by the Peltier effect (which also goes by the more general name
                          thermoelectric effect). The device has two sides, and when a DC electric current flows through
                          the device, it brings heat from one side to the other, so that one side gets cooler while the 
                          other gets hotter. The "hot" side is attached to a heat sink so that it remains at ambient 
                          temperature, while the cool side goes below room temperature. In some applications, multiple 
                          coolers can be cascaded together for lower temperature.
                          
       Construction: Two unique semiconductors, one n-type and one p-type, are used because they need to have different 
                      electron densities. The semiconductors are placed thermally in parallel to each other and electrically
                      in series and then joined with a thermally conducting plate on each side. When a voltage is applied to
                      the free ends of the two semiconductors there is a flow of DC current across the junction of the
                      semiconductors causing a temperature difference. The side with the cooling plate absorbs heat which
                      is then moved to the other side of the device where the heat sink is. Thermoelectric Coolers, also 
                      abbreviated to TECs are typically connected side by side and sandwiched between two ceramic plates.
                      The cooling ability of the total unit is then proportional to the number of TECs in it.
                      
Intelligence : Developed a smart power saving mechanism i.e when the certain specified temperature is acheived and Turns-Automatically.
               Using esp8266 made it operatable from anywhere(Using Internet).
                      
Design : This was the most important factor :P ,we spent a lot of time to get its cool attitude.

Power : Initially we ran the cooler with a Lipo batteries 
        Later improved power efficiency and used Voltage boosters made it work with double USB power from laptop.(Making it more suitable on Table)
        
Some benefits of using a TEC are:

    ->No moving parts so maintenance is required less frequently
    ->No chlorofluorocarbons (CFC)
    ->Temperature control to within fractions of a degree can be maintained
    ->Flexible shape (form factor); in particular, they can have a very small size
    ->Can be used in environments that are smaller or more severe than conventional refrigeration
    ->Long life, with mean time between failures (MTBF) exceeding 100,000 hours
    ->Controllable via changing the input voltage/current

Some disadvantages[4] of using a TEC are:

    ->Only a limited amount of heat flux is able to be dissipated
    ->Relegated to applications with low heat flux
    ->Not as efficient, in terms of coefficient of performance, as vapor-compression systems.
